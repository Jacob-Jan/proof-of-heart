    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      Proof of Heart is a Nostr-native charity platform. Charities connect with a Nostr signer,
      publish profile data as events, and receive donations directly through their own
      lightning/zap endpoints. The platform indexes public data, improves discovery, and applies
      transparent community moderation. No custody. No private key collection. Don’t trust, verify.

    <h2>1. Platform principles</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Charity identity is anchored to a public key (npub).</li>
      <li>Profile metadata is portable and relay-based.</li>
      <li>Community signals (followers, reports, ratings) are open and auditable.</li>
      <li>Donations are direct, non-custodial, and charity-controlled.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Product model</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Nostr connect for charities:</strong> sign in with a NIP-07 signer (extension/connector), never share private key.</li>
      <li><strong>Base profile from Nostr metadata:</strong> re-use standard profile data immediately.</li>
      <li><strong>Proof of Heart extension fields:</strong> publish app-specific charity fields via custom kind events.</li>
      <li><strong>Direct giving:</strong> donors donate via lightning/zaps to charity-controlled endpoints.</li>
      <li><strong>Open reputation:</strong> follower counts, ratings, and reports are visible and explainable.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Event model</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>kind 0:</strong> standard Nostr profile metadata (name, picture, about, lud16/lud06, etc.).</li>
      <li><strong>kind 30078:</strong> Proof of Heart charity profile extension (mission, country, category, donation message, optional lightning override).</li>
      <li><strong>kind 30079:</strong> Proof of Heart charity rating events.</li>
      <li><strong>kind 1984 (NIP-56):</strong> reports/flags for moderation signals.</li>
      <li><strong>kind 3:</strong> follow graph used for social proof (follower count estimation).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Moderation policy (transparent + tunable)</h2>
    <p>
      Moderation is based on public events and deterministic rules, not hidden admin actions.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reports are counted by unique reporter pubkeys.</li>
      <li>Charities can be soft-hidden when report threshold is reached.</li>
      <li>Thresholds are configurable (e.g., 1 for strict mode, 3 for balanced mode).</li>
      <li>Hidden status is explainable in UI ("hidden due to X flags").</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Donations and trust model</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Proof of Heart does not custody funds.</li>
      <li>Donors pay charity endpoints directly.</li>
      <li>Trust comes from open identity, cross-checkable metadata, and public social signals.</li>
      <li>Platform value is discovery, indexing, and safer UX—not financial intermediation.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Roadmap</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Improve relay coverage strategy</li>
      <li>Add insight in raters</li>
      <li>Add insight in flaggers</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Proof of Heart provides open identities, open reputation, and direct Bitcoin donations for charities.
      The goal is to help donors support legitimate charities with minimal trust and maximal transparency.
