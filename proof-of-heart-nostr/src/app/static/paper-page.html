  <section><h2>Abstract</h2><p>Proof of Heart is a free service, providing a web application that lets any charity publish a profile with bitcoin donation endpoints, enabling donors to give without intermediaries. We will provide donors with easy options to verify themselves whether a charity profile is legitimate. Don’t trust, verify.</p></section>
  <section><h2>1. Purpose</h2><p>Charitable giving is too often mediated by platforms that custody funds, harvest data, throttle access, or de-platform at will. Donors lose privacy; charities lose sovereignty; both pay rent to gatekeepers.</p><p>The internet made giving global, Bitcoin fixes the money. Proof of Heart fixes discovery and trust: a clear, public way to find and verify charities and pay them directly.</p></section>
  <section><h2>2. Product</h2><ul><li>Public charity profiles</li><li>Direct donation endpoints: charity-controlled BTCPay Server</li><li>Options to verify charity profiles</li><li>Design principles: directness over intermediaries; verifiability over virality; privacy by default; no tokens, no rent-seeking.</li></ul></section>
  <section><h2>3. Architecture &amp; Flow</h2><h3>Roles</h3><ul><li>Charity: controls its own receiving infrastructure.</li><li>Donor: chooses (and verifies) a charity and pays at the charity’s endpoint.</li><li>Register (Proof of Heart): lists charities, verifies simple proofs, and helps donors navigate safely.</li></ul></section>
  <section><h2>4. Roadmap</h2><h3>Live</h3><ul><li>Register + profiles</li><li>Direct BTCPay links</li></ul><h3>Upcoming</h3><ul><li>Filter charities on cause, region, proof, etc.</li><li>Charity profile verification proofs.</li><li>Community signal: rate, review, and flag charities</li></ul></section>
  <section><h2>5. Conclusion</h2><p>Proof of Heart is deliberately narrow, a clean register with simple proofs and a clear path to find, verify and donate bitcoin to charities. No custody, no intermediaries. Just donors, charities and Bitcoin doing what it already does best.</p></section>
