<h2>About us</h2>
<p>
    The information age is rapidly taking shape. More and more people decide to adopt Bitcoin as the only sound money
    currently available in cyberspace. At the time of writing this blogpost, nearly all charities are still
    using government controlled money (fiat).
</p>
<h3>Why</h3>
<p>
    Our mission is to help charities make the switch to the Bitcoin standard and provide the Bitcoin community with
    options to donate to charities who align with their vision.
</p>

<h3>How</h3>
<p>
    Our vision to enhance the Bitcoin community is twofold. On the one hand, by creating a donation platform where the
    donor is assured that the bitcoin will be sent directly to the charity's wallet, and on the other hand, by
    onboarding charities to the Bitcoin standard.
</p>

<h3>What</h3>
<p>
    We have developed a user-friendly WebApp that allows donors to browse a curated list of charities and make donations directly to their Bitcoin addresses via the charity's BTCPay Server.
</p>

<h3>Funding</h3>
<p>
    Charities will always have a way to access the platform for free.
</p>

<h3>Who</h3>
<p>
    We are Maurits and Jacob, Bitcoin maximalists from the Netherlands.
