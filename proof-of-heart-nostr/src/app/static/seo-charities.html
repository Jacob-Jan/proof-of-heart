    <h2>What Is a Bitcoin Charity Donation Endpoint?</h2>
    <p>
      A <strong>bitcoin charity</strong> donation endpoint is a single, reusable destination that
      donors can trust:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>An on-chain bitcoin address and QR code for donations.</li>
      <li>Optionally, a lightning endpoint for fast, low-fee payments.</li>
      <li>Public information about the charity and how funds are used.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Instead of random addresses scattered across the internet, an endpoint gives donors one
      canonical place to donate bitcoin and verify the non-profit’s details.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Openness Matters for Bitcoin Charities</h2>
    <p>
      Bitcoin donors want to be confident that their support is going to the right organization.
      An open profile on Proof of Heart helps by:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Publishing clear information:</strong>
        name, mission, links, and donation details.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Reducing impersonation risk:</strong>
        donors can compare the profile with the charity’s own website.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Enabling community review:</strong>
        anyone can inspect endpoints and evaluate the organization.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Your endpoint becomes the reference point for donors who want to support your bitcoin
      charity safely.

    <h2>Direct Bitcoin Donations and Self-Custody</h2>
    <p>
      When your organization is listed on Proof of Heart, donations do not pass through a custodial
      platform. Instead:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The charity controls its own keys and funds.</li>
      <li>Donors see exactly where they send bitcoin or lightning payments.</li>
      <li>There is no platform balance to withdraw from or lose access to.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This self-custody model treats bitcoin non-profits as full Bitcoin users, not just
      beneficiaries of payouts.
