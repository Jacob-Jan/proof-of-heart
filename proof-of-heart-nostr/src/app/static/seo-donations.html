    <h2>How Bitcoin Donations Work</h2>
    <p>
      A bitcoin donation is a transaction on the Bitcoin network from your address to a charity’s
      address. In practice, the process is simple:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Find a charity that accepts bitcoin on Proof of Heart.</li>
      <li>Open its official bitcoin donation profile.</li>
      <li>Send funds from your wallet to the on-chain address or lightning invoice.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The transaction is recorded on the blockchain (or via lightning), and the charity can manage
      the funds directly in its own wallet.
    </p>

    <h2>Donate Bitcoin vs Donate Lightning</h2>
    <p>
      Many charities listed on Proof of Heart can receive both
      <strong>on-chain bitcoin donations</strong> and
      <strong>lightning donations</strong>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>On-chain bitcoin</strong> is ideal for larger or less frequent gifts.</li>
      <li><strong>Lightning donations</strong> are perfect for small, instant contributions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Proof of Heart treats both as part of a single donation endpoint. You choose how to donate
      bitcoin based on your wallet, fees, and the urgency of your support.

    <h2>Why Self-Custody Matters for Bitcoin Donations</h2>
    <p>
      A self-custody charity holds its own keys instead of relying on an exchange or custodial
      payment processor. This matters because:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Funds cannot be frozen by a third-party custodian.</li>
      <li>The organization designs its own security and treasury policy.</li>
      <li>There is a direct relationship between donor and recipient on the Bitcoin network.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When you donate bitcoin on Proof of Heart, you support charities that treat bitcoin as a
      native asset, held in wallets they control.
