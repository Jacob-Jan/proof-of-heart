    <h1>Proof of Heart - Open Bitcoin Charity Platform</h1>
    <p>
      Proof of Heart is built on a simple idea: <strong>bitcoin donations</strong> should flow
      directly from donors to charities, using open infrastructure instead of closed, custodial
      platforms. This page explains why the Proof of Heart bitcoin charity platform exists.

    <h2>The Problem with Traditional Donation Platforms</h2>
    <p>
      Traditional online donation platforms sit between donors and charities. They hold funds,
      charge fees, restrict regions, and sometimes block recipients entirely. For many non-profits,
      especially in sensitive environments, this is fragile and limiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bitcoin offers an alternative: anyone can send value directly to anyone else. But for
      <strong>bitcoin donations</strong> to work well for non-profits, they need:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clear, trustworthy information about where to donate bitcoin.</li>
      <li>Simple ways to discover bitcoin charities and non-profits.</li>
      <li>Infrastructure that never takes custody of funds.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A Non-Custodial Bitcoin Charity Platform</h2>
    <p>
      Proof of Heart focuses on publishing information, not holding money. Charities create a
      profile and share their bitcoin and lightning donation endpoints. Donors use their own
      wallets to support the charity directly.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>No internal balances on the platform.</li>
      <li>No custody of donor funds by Proof of Heart.</li>
      <li>Charities remain responsible for their wallets and keys.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This non-custodial model aligns with Bitcoin's core principles: self-custody, openness, and
      resistance to censorship.

    <h2>Open Infrastructure for Bitcoin Donations</h2>
    <p>
      Proof of Heart is meant to be open infrastructure rather than a closed, gatekept product. It
      aims to provide:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A neutral way to describe bitcoin and lightning donation endpoints.</li>
      <li>Public, machine-readable profiles that other tools can build on.</li>
      <li>A shared index of charities that accept bitcoin donations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Wallets, explorers, and grassroots campaigns can point to these profiles when they want to
      highlight bitcoin charities and non-profits.
    </p>

    <h2>Principles Behind Proof of Heart</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Open by default:</strong> Profiles and endpoints are publicly visible.</li>
      <li><strong>Non-custodial:</strong> The platform never holds donor funds.</li>
      <li><strong>Permissionless:</strong> Any eligible charity can publish a profile.</li>
      <li><strong>Interoperable:</strong> Data can be reused by other tools in the ecosystem.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you share these values and want to accept bitcoin donations, you can
