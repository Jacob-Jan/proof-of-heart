  <h1>About us</h1>
  <p>
    The information age is rapidly taking shape. More and more people decide to adopt Bitcoin as the only sound money
    currently available in cyberspace (<a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&category=Addresses&chartStyle=line&ema=0&m=addresses.ActiveCount&mAvg=0&mMedian=0&mScl=lin&pScl=lin&resolution=1w&s=1230508800&u=1712880000&zoom=">Glassnode</a>). At the time of writing this blogpost, nearly all charities are still
    using government controlled money (fiat). We believe that our planet will greatly benefit from a decentralized and
    sustainable form of money (<a href="https://saifedean.com/tbs">Ammous</a>).
  </p>
  <h3>Why</h3>
  <p>
    Our mission is to help charities make the switch to the Bitcoin standard and provide the Bitcoin community with
    options to donate to charities who align with their vision.
  </p>
  <h3>How</h3>
  <p>
    Our vision is twofold: create a donation platform where the donor is assured that bitcoin will be sent directly to the charity wallet, and onboard charities to self-custody.
  </p>
  <h3>Who</h3>
  <p>
    We are Maurits and Jacob, Bitcoin maximalists from the Netherlands.
