  <h1>Join as a charity</h1>
  <p>You’re about to connect your Nostr identity and open your public charity profile page. You can edit details right after.</p>
  <p>If you already have a charity profile, that’s fine — this step just confirms this npub is being used for a charity.</p>
  <p>Before continuing, confirm this Nostr identity belongs to a charity organization.</p>

  <div class="confirm-row">
    <mat-checkbox [(ngModel)]="charityConfirmed">This npub belongs to a charity.</mat-checkbox>
  </div>

  <button mat-flat-button type="button" (click)="continueToProfile()" [disabled]="loading || !charityConfirmed">
    {{ loading ? 'Connecting…' : 'Connect Nostr' }}
  </button>
